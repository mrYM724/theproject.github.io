    <strong>
    <p class="summary">
      <span>WHO declared Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a pandemic which originated at the city of Wuhan, China. 
      Multiple strategies were implemented by the Indian government to handle the current outbreak which include 55 days lockdown throughout the country that started on 24 March 2020.
      Lockdown on economic activities gave the benefits of reducing air pollution in India dramatically.
      The project examines the impact of lockdown on Air Pollution in India by comparing various data indicator's of the Earth Observation Dashboard, during the lockdown period with those of the previous years. This is indeed an appropriate time to conduct analyses to impact and bend the curve of air pollution substantially. </span>

      Coronavirus (COVID-19) is highly infectious and fatal to human life.
      About 3.9 million people till date have lost their life which is approximately equal
      to the population of Los Angeles, California. Government's around the world 
      imposed travel and business restriction to slow down the spread of COVID-19. 
    </p>
    <div class="hello">

      <img class="theimages" src="coviddata3.png" />
    </div>
    <p>
      As per the COVID-19 data on the Earth Observation Dashboard there was a 4 times increase
      in COVID patients in the country from March 10, 2020 to March 20, 2020 as you can see from the first 2 pictures above. Later, COVID patients increased 4 times the number from 20 March, 2020 to 31 March, 2020 again.
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, Indian Government imposed a 'Janata' (public) curfew which was followed by a strict lockdown on 24 March 2020. People were forced to sit at homes and also work from home.
      Therefore the city streets were quiet with no traffic on the roads.</p>

       Dashboard. The blue colored parts represent a slowdown in activity

    <p> The above photograph is from the area near the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT). We can even see how 
      lockdown and the port's activity had affected the nearby areas by slowing down their activity.

      <p>  In India, on 24th March when lockdown was implemented, the mobility data indicator on the Earth Observation dashboard shows there was around 48 percent decline in people visits at the grocery markets, food warehouses, farmers markets, specialty food shops, drug stores, and pharmacies.  A 44 percent decrease in the park visits. A whooping 68 percent decrease in visits at places like restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, theme parks, museums, libraries, and movie theaters and a 64 percent decrease in the travelers and visitors at transit stations such as train stations, subways and bus stations. </p>
      <p>The decrease of Import / Export industry and decrease of visitors at transit stations, grocery stations, restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, theme parks, museums, libraries, and movie theaters led to the downfall of the economy of India.</p>
      <p>Due to downfall of economic activities, traffic related emissions like NO2 and CO2 dropped drastically from March, 2020 during the lockdown. The drop in CO2 emissions is very small compared to NO2 emissions as we can see in the below pictures.</p>
    </div>

    <p id="textthealign" >The first image above is from Early April 2019. The second image is from Early April 2020. We can easily see how the NO2 levels have decreased from 2019 to 2020.</p>

    <p>Now, we will be zooming into how the lockdown changed the air quality of the two most important and most polluted cities of India, namely Mumbai and Delhi.</p>
    <img src="mumbaiair.png" class="theimages"/>
    <img src="mumbaigreenhouse.png" class="theimages" />
    <p>In the above images we can see significant drop in NO2 concentrations and greenhouse gases in March 2020 and April 2020. Which was just when the lockdown started.</p>
    <img src="delhiair.png" class="theimages" />
    <img src="delhigreenhouse.png" class="theimages" />
    <p> In the above images we also see a magnificant drop in NO2 concentrations and greenhouse gases but with a much better rate comparing it to Mumbai.</p>

    <h3>We basically analysed how due to the lockdown, the air quality improved. But what level of air quality we got? Was it actually significant or not?</h3>
    <h3>Now we are going to analyse the impact of the air quality on our surroundings. Now, we are going to fundamentally analyze and watch the impact on the North Indian region.</h3>
    <p id="textthealign" >The northern India experienced a significant drop in NO2 levels which led to a decrease in haze in that area. </p>
    <p id="textthealign" > On 3rd April people of Jalandhar, Punjab, a state in Northern India could see a clear glimpse of the Himalayas, which was approximately 200 km away from them. Residents of Jalandhar had told that they have not seen the Himalayan ranges for around the 30 past years. </p>
    <p id="textthealign" >  This was due to the significant decrease in NO2 emissions which improved the air quality of India and it's major cities like Delhi and Mumbai.</p>

    <p>India is ranked at 179th position out of 180 countries in Air quality by Yale University. Delhi and Mumbai are one of the most polluted cities in the world. High levels of NO2 have detrimental effects on human health. It can cause severe coughing and other respiratory diseases like asthma. </p>
    <p>A research project to improve air quality has been running in Delhi since 2017 which was for India's National Clear Air Program launched in 2019. The objective of this program was to decrease particulate matter concentrations in the countries most polluted cities. This particulates come from activities like coal and wood burning for eating and cooking, construction dust and waste burnouts and also arise from chemicals emitted by diesel, petrol and gas powered vehicles. Many such researches has been carried out in India and other countries to improve the air quality but all went in vain when it came to practicality. Covid-19 pandemic has actually taught a lesson to us as we were struggling to improve our air quality as because of lockdown we got reduction in greenhouse gases and NO2 emissions which would either not be possible.</p>
    <h3>A beneficial short term effect on the natural enviornment across cities was seen.</h3>
    <img class="theimages2" src="delhi.jpg" />
    <p>Now we have to see to it that this air quality should remain permanent and not end with the ending of lockdown. We have to make a change in our lifestyle and our behavior and see to it that we regain this air quality. Thus, impact of COVID-19 pandemic has proved as a 'Blessing in Disguise' for humans.</p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>Earlier we were struggling to improve our air quality and stop air pollution. Pandemic has actually taught a lesson to us. COVID-19 pandemic has given us a scope to realise the restoration ability of enviornment and health.</p>
    <br>
    <h3> What can common people do to improve air quality?</h3>
    <p> 1) Keep indoor plants in your house to improve air quality of your house. </p>
    <P> 2) Use Solar panels for generarting electricity for your home, if you have the ability to do so.</P>
    <p> 3) Use bicycles to travel to nearby places.</p>
    <p> 4) Buy an electric vehicle, only if you have the ability to do so.</p>
    <p> 5) Wood burning and coal burning in rural areas should be avoided.</p>
    <p> 6) Avoid burning leaves, trash, and other materials.</p>
    <p> 7) Solar heaters should be used for cooking.</p>
    <p> 8) We should stop using gas powered lawn mower.</p>
    <p> 9) Using filters for chimney is beneficial.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Now we have hopes. We can make use of biofuels for vehicles and use of electrified vehicles for transportation purposes. Hybrid work places should be generated so there is no issue of road traffic leading to smoke and emissions. We can replace fossil fuels to biofuels and solar power which are green energy sources reducing the air pollution permanently to have a suustainable future for the next generation.
